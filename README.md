# desynced-toggle-puzzle
## What it does
This code generates a list of solutions for one of the early puzzles in the
[Desynced video game] (https://www.desyncedgame.com/).
The puzzle involves clicking on cells in a 3x3 grid, with the center cell not available.
The goal is to change all the red cells into blue cells.
Clicking on a given cell changes that cell and all of its neighbors, where
a neighbor shares a common edge or common corner with the cell.
## Jumping to the solution
For folks that want the solutions but do not want to deal with compiling the
program can access the [results file (https://github.com/asoftwareguydoinghardware/desynced-toggle-puzzle/blob/main/solution.txt)](https://github.com/asoftwareguydoinghardware/desynced-toggle-puzzle/blob/main/solution.txt).
This file was create by running the program and then manually adding a bit
of information at the top of the file to explain things that are unlikely
to be obvious without some explanation.
